# DIGI_LOCK
# It is required to implement a digital lock that will accept a specific bit sequence  “101100” through an input button “b_in” serially in synchronism with the negative edge of an input clock, and will generate an “unlock” signal “1” as output; for any other bit sequence the “unlock” signal will remain at logic “0”.  An active low “clear” signal is used to asynchronously reset the lock in its initial/default state.

# Write a Verilog module to implement the specification as Moore machine using the following template:
#    module dlock (unlock, b_in, clear, clk);

# AIM:
To stimulate and synthesis digital lock using Vivado.

# Software Required:
vivado 2023.2 software.

# Procedure:
STEP:1 Start the vivado software, Select and Name the New project.

STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed.

STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type.

STEP:4 Type the File Name and module name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it.

STEP:5 Select the run simulation and then run Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax.

STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table.

STEP:7 compare the output with truth table.
